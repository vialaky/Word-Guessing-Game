# Word-Guessing-Game

## Project Description

The program thinks of a word, and the user must guess it. Initially, all letters of the word are unknown. A gallows with a noose is also drawn.  
The user suggests a letter that can be included in this word. If such a letter is in a word, then the program places the letter as many times as it appears in the word. If there is no such letter, a circle in a loop representing a head is added to the gallows.  
The user continues to guess the letters until he guesses the entire word. For each unsuccessful attempt, another part of the hanged manâ€™s torso is added (usually there are 6 of them: head, torso, 2 arms and 2 legs.
